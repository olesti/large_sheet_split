# Large Excel Sheet Splitter: Node.js Script for Grouping and Splitting Data into CSV 

This Node.js console application is designed to simplify the task of working with large Excel files. It automates the process of:

* **Grouping data:** Identifying and grouping data within a specified column.
* **File splitting:** Exporting each group to a new Excel or CSV file. 

By breaking down large, complex datasets into smaller, more focused files, this application enhances data organization, facilitates analysis, and improves overall productivity.
